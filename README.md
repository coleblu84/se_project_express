# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project served as a learning tool to understand how to build and work on the backend of a web application. It covered setting up a linter, configuring entry points, and enabling hot reloading. I also learned how to connect Mongoose to the project and worked with Schemas, Routes, and Controllers. To wrap it up, I used Postman for testing endpoints and GitHub Actions to automate code testing before submission.
